# https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pyaudio
# https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
# To install PyAudio, Run in the Anaconda Terminal CMD: conda install -c anaconda pyaudio
# Pre-requisite for running PyAudio installation - Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater will be required. Get it with "Microsoft C++ Build Tools" : https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
# To run PyAudio on Colab, please install PyAudio.whl in your local system and give that path to colab for installation
